        <h1>TO MY LOVELY WIFE</h1>
        <p> <strong>Rhoanne is the light of my life</strong>, bringing joy and warmth to every moment we share together.
            Her smile brightens my darkest days, and <em>her laughter is the sweetest melody I know</em>. I am endlessly 
            grateful for her love.</p>

         <p>My love for her grows stronger with each passing day, <em>deepening like the roots of an ancient tree
            together, we face life's challenges hand in hand, knowing that our love will always see us through</em>.</p> 

         <p>PS: I know your pressure love, <strong>but you can do it!</strong> <strong>I LOVE YOU</strong></p>
